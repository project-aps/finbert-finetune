# FinBERT Fine-Tuned on Financial News/Texts

A fine-tuned version of [`ProsusAI/finbert`](https://huggingface.co/ProsusAI/finbert) trained for **financial sentiment analysis** on financial news texts and headlines.
This fine-tuned model achieves a significant improvement over the original finbert, **outperforming it by over 38% in accuracy** on financial sentiment classification tasks.

## Model Objective

The goal of this model is to detect **positive**, **neutral**, or **negative sentiment** on financial texts and headlines.

## Training Dataset

**Primary Dataset**: [`fingpt-sentiment-train`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/FinGPT/fingpt-sentiment-train) (~60,000 examples)

-   Labeled financial text samples (positive / neutral / negative)
-   Includes earnings statements, market commentary, and financial news headlines
-   Only included **neutral**, **positive** and **negative** texts.

## Benchmark Evaluation

The model was evaluated against **three benchmark datasets**:

-   **[Financial PhraseBank (All Agree and All Combined)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/251231364_FinancialPhraseBank-v10)**
-   **[FiQA + PhraseBank Kaggle Merge](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sbhatti/financial-sentiment-analysis/data)**
-   **[fingpt-sentiment-train (test split)](https://huggingface.co/datasets/FinGPT/fingpt-sentiment-train)**

Metrics used:

-   **Accuracy**
-   **F1 Score**
-   **Precision**
-   **Recall**

We benchmarked this model against the original [`ProsusAI/finbert`](https://huggingface.co/ProsusAI/finbert) on multiple financial datasets:

## Text-Level Comparison: FinBERT vs FinBERT-Finetuned (Ours)

### FinBERT Failed Texts (as per discussed in its [`Paper`](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.10063)) (Correctly Predicted by Ours)

| Text                                                                                                                       | Expected | FinBERT              | Ours                 |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | -------------------- | -------------------- |
| Pre-tax loss totaled euro 0.3 million, compared to a loss of euro 2.2 million in the first quarter of 2005.                | Positive | ❌ Negative (0.7223) | ✅ Positive (0.9997) |
| This implementation is very important to the operator, since it is about to launch its Fixed to Mobile convergence service | Neutral  | ❌ Positive (0.7204) | ✅ Neutral (0.9998)  |
| The situation of coated magazine printing paper will continue to be weak.                                                  | Negative | ✅ Negative (0.8811) | ✅ Negative (0.9996) |

### FinBERT Incorrect, Ours Corrected It

| Text                                                                                            | Expected | FinBERT              | Ours                 |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | -------------------- | -------------------- |
| The debt-to-equity ratio was 1.15, flat quarter-over-quarter.                                   | Neutral  | ❌ Negative (0.6239) | ✅ Neutral (0.9998)  |
| Earnings smashed expectations $AAPL posts $0.89 EPS vs $0.78 est. Bullish momentum incoming!    | Positive | ❌ Neutral (0.4237)  | ✅ Positive (0.9998) |
| $TSLA growth is slowing — but hey, at least Elon tweeted something funny today. #Tesla #markets | Negative | ❌ Neutral (0.5884)  | ✅ Negative (0.7084) |

### Out-of-Context Texts (FinBERT Misclassified, Ours Handled Properly)

| Text                                                           | Expected | FinBERT              | Ours                |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | -------------------- | ------------------- |
| Unexpected Snowstorm Hits Sahara Desert, Blanketing Sand Dunes | Neutral  | ❌ Negative (0.8675) | ✅ Neutral (0.9993) |
| Virtual Reality Therapy Shows Promise for Treating PTSD        | Neutral  | ❌ Positive (0.8522) | ✅ Neutral (0.9997) |

> **Note**: These examples demonstrate improvements in real-world understanding, context handling, and sentiment differentiation with our FinBERT-finetuned model. Values in parentheses (e.g., `0.9485`) indicate the model’s confidence score for its predicted sentiment.

## Limitations & Failure Cases

While the model outperformed the base FinBERT across benchmarks, **some failure cases** were observed in statements involving **fine-grained numerical reasoning**, particularly when numerical comparison semantics are complex or subtle.

| Text                                                                                               | Expected | FinBERT              | Ours                 |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | -------------------- | -------------------- |
| Net profit to euro 203 million from euro 172 million in the previous year.                         | Positive | ✅ Positive (0.9485) | ✅ Positive (0.9995) |
| Net profit to euro 103 million from euro 172 million in the previous year.                         | Negative | ❌ Positive (0.9486) | ❌ Positive (0.9994) |
| Pre-tax loss totaled euro 0.3 million, compared to a loss of euro 2.2 million in Q1 2005.          | Positive | ❌ Negative (0.7223) | ✅ Positive (0.9997) |
| Pre-tax loss totaled euro 5.3 million, compared to a loss of euro 2.2 million in Q1 2005.          | Negative | ✅ Negative (0.7205) | ❌ Positive (0.9997) |
| Net profit totaled euro 5.3 million, compared to euro 2.2 million in the previous quarter of 2005. | Positive | ❌ Negative (0.6347) | ❌ Negative (0.9996) |
| Net profit totaled euro 0.3 million, compared to euro 2.2 million in the previous quarter of 2005. | Negative | ✅ Negative (0.6320) | ✅ Negative (0.9996) |

> **Note**: Values in parentheses (e.g., `0.9485`) indicate the model’s confidence score for its predicted sentiment.

This suggests that **explicit numerical comparison reasoning** still remains challenging without targeted pretraining or numerical reasoning augmentation.

## Hyperparameters

During fine-tuning, the following hyperparameters were used to optimize model performance:

-   **Learning Rate:** 2e-5
-   **Batch Size:** 32
-   **Number of Epochs:** 3
-   **Max Sequence Length:** 128 tokens
-   **Optimizer:** AdamW
-   **Weight Decay:** 0.01
-   **Evaluation Strategy:** Evaluation performed after each epoch

> **Note**: These settings were chosen to balance training efficiency and accuracy for financial news sentiment classification.

## Summary

✅ **Better generalization** than FinBERT on both benchmark and noisy real-world samples  
✅ **Strong accuracy and F1 scores**  
⚠️ Room to improve on **numerical reasoning comparisons** — potential for integration with numerical-aware transformers or contrastive fine-tuning

## Usage

### Pipeline Approach

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSequenceClassification, pipeline
import torch

model_name = "project-aps/finbert-finetune"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Override the config's id2label and label2id
label_map = {0: "neutral", 1: "negative", 2: "positive"}
model.config.id2label = label_map
model.config.label2id = {v: k for k, v in label_map.items()}

pipe = pipeline("text-classification", model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer)

text = "Earnings smashed expectations AAPL posts $0.89 EPS vs $0.78 est. Bullish momentum incoming! #EarningsSeason"
print(pipe(text)) #Output: [{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.9997484087944031}]

```

### Simple Approach

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSequenceClassification
import torch

model_name = "project-aps/finbert-finetune"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_name)

text = "Earnings smashed expectations AAPL posts $0.89 EPS vs $0.78 est. Bullish momentum incoming! #EarningsSeason"
inputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors="pt", truncation=True)
outputs = model(**inputs)
predicted_class = torch.argmax(outputs.logits, dim=1).item()

label_map = {0: "neutral", 1: "negative", 2: "positive"}
print(f"Text : {text}")
print(f"Sentiment: {label_map[predicted_class]}")

```
